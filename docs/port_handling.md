# Nova Enclave Capsule Port Handling

This document explains how Nova Enclave Capsule handles ports end-to-end, within Nova Enclave Capsule itself.

Scope:
- Included: `capsule-cli build`, `capsule-cli run`, `capsule-shell` (capsule-shell), `capsule-runtime`, `ingress`, API/Aux API/Helios listeners.
- Excluded: external reverse proxies and platform-specific ingress layers.

For a deeper explanation of the CID-derived host-side VSOCK model, see
`docs/vsock_runtime.md`.

Multi-instance support:
- Multiple `capsule-cli run` processes can run on the same EC2 instance.
- `capsule-shell` picks a managed enclave CID for each instance and derives host-side VSOCK listeners for egress, clock sync, and hostfs from that CID.
- Docker-published TCP ports (`-p host:container`) still need to be unique per container, just like normal Docker workloads.

## Port Layers

Nova Enclave Capsule networking has three relevant layers:

1. Host -> Capsule Shell container (`docker` port publishing)
   - Controlled by `capsule-cli run -p HOST_PORT:CONTAINER_PORT`.

2. Capsule Shell container TCP -> Enclave vsock (`HostProxy`)
   - Controlled by `manifest.ingress[].listen_port`.
   - Started by `capsule-shell` inside the capsule-shell container.

3. Enclave vsock -> Enclave localhost TCP (`EnclaveProxy`)
   - Controlled by `manifest.ingress[].listen_port`.
   - Started by `capsule-runtime` inside the enclave.

For inbound traffic to work, all required layers must align.

## Who Reads Which Config

### `capsule-cli build`

- Reads `capsule.yaml`.
- Packages the manifest into the release image (`/enclave/capsule.yaml`) for capsule-shell.
- Also injects manifest into the enclave app layer (`/etc/capsule/capsule.yaml`) for capsule-runtime.

### `capsule-cli run` (CLI)

- `-f/--file` is used to resolve `manifest.target` when image name is not provided.
- `-f/--file` (or the default local `capsule.yaml`) is also how runtime `--mount` bindings are resolved against `storage.mounts[]`.
- `--publish/-p` is the only source of Docker host port publishing.
- `--mount` is rejected in image-name-only mode because there is no manifest to resolve.
- It does not auto-publish ports from `manifest.ingress`.

### `capsule-shell` (capsule-shell runtime in container)

- Loads packaged manifest.
- Chooses a managed enclave CID and launches Nitro CLI with that explicit CID.
- Starts host-side ingress proxies for each `manifest.ingress[].listen_port`.
- Each proxy listens on container `0.0.0.0:<listen_port>` and forwards to enclave vsock `<listen_port>`.
- Starts host-side runtime VSOCK listeners for egress (when enabled), clock sync, and hostfs on ports derived from the managed CID.

### `capsule-runtime` (inside enclave)

- Loads manifest from `/etc/capsule/capsule.yaml`.
- Starts enclave-side ingress listeners for each `manifest.ingress[].listen_port`.
- For each incoming vsock stream, forwards to `127.0.0.1:<listen_port>` in enclave.

## Service Ports vs Ingress Ports

Application services are typically localhost listeners inside enclave:

- App service: usually your app port (example `8080`)
- Capsule API: `api.listen_port` (example `18000`)
- Aux API: `aux_api.listen_port` if set, otherwise `api.listen_port + 1`
  - Aux API is part of the API contract because attestation flows depend on it
  - if `api.listen_port + 1` would overflow `u16`, the manifest must set `aux_api.listen_port` explicitly
- Helios RPC: `helios_rpc.chains[].local_rpc_port` (per-chain port, often `18545` for Nova registry discovery)

These are not externally reachable by default. They become reachable only if:

1. The same port is listed in `ingress`.
2. The port is published via `capsule-cli run -p host:container`.

## Practical Example

Manifest:

```yaml
ingress:
  - listen_port: 8080
  - listen_port: 18001

api:
  listen_port: 18000
aux_api:
  listen_port: 18001
```

Run:

```bash
capsule-cli run my-image:latest \
  -p 8000:8080 \
  -p 8001:18001
```

Result:

- Host `:8000` -> container `:8080` -> enclave app `127.0.0.1:8080`
- Host `:8001` -> container `:18001` -> enclave aux API `127.0.0.1:18001`
- Capsule API `18000` is still not externally reachable (not in `ingress` and not published)

## Host-side Runtime VSOCK Ports

The fixed VSOCK ports inside the enclave are:

- `17000` for app status
- `17001` for app log streaming

Host-side runtime listeners are not fixed globally. Nova Enclave Capsule derives them from
the managed enclave CID using a per-CID VSOCK block:

- egress: `20000 + (CID * 128) + 0`
- clock sync: `20000 + (CID * 128) + 1`
- hostfs mount `N`: `20000 + (CID * 128) + 16 + N`

That is what allows multiple Nova Enclave Capsule instances on one EC2 to run without
colliding on host-side runtime VSOCK listeners.

## Common Pitfalls

1. Added `ingress` entry but forgot `-p`
   - Proxy exists in capsule-shell, but host cannot reach container port.

2. Added `-p` but port not in `ingress`
   - Docker forwards to container port, but no `HostProxy` is listening there.

3. Added `ingress` and `-p`, but service is not listening in enclave
   - `EnclaveProxy` forwards to `127.0.0.1:<port>` and connection fails.

4. Protocol mismatch on ingress port
   - Example: sending REST-style requests to a JSON-RPC endpoint.

5. Used `--mount` without loading a manifest
   - Runtime mount resolution needs `storage.mounts[]` from `-f` or the default local `capsule.yaml`.

6. Changed `storage.mounts[]` order without realizing it affects hostfs VSOCK ports
   - Host and enclave both derive mount ports from manifest order.

## Validation Checklist

To expose a new port safely:

1. Service inside enclave listens on `127.0.0.1:<PORT>`.
2. `ingress` includes `listen_port: <PORT>`.
3. `capsule-cli run` includes `-p HOST_PORT:<PORT>`.
4. Endpoint/protocol test matches service behavior (for example JSON-RPC vs REST path style).
