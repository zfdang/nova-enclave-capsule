# Enclaver Base Images

This document summarizes the base images used by Enclaver, what they contain (as inferred from this repository), and commands you can run locally to inspect them.

Date: 2025-10-27

Overview
--------
Enclaver uses three primary base images in its build and runtime flow. The repository references these images as defaults when a manifest doesn't override them. The images are published under the public ECR hostname used in this project.

- Nitro CLI image: `public.ecr.aws/s2t1d4c6/enclaver-io/nitro-cli:latest`
- ODYN image (supervisor): `public.ecr.aws/d4t4u8d2/sparsity-ai/odyn:latest`
- Sleeve / wrapper base image: `public.ecr.aws/d4t4u8d2/sparsity-ai/enclaver-wrapper-base:latest`

Where these are referenced in the repository
-----------------------------------------
- `enclaver/src/build.rs` contains the defaults used by `EnclaveArtifactBuilder`:

```rust
  const NITRO_CLI_IMAGE: &str = "public.ecr.aws/s2t1d4c6/enclaver-io/nitro-cli:latest";
  const ODYN_IMAGE: &str = "public.ecr.aws/d4t4u8d2/sparsity-ai/odyn:latest";
  const SLEEVE_IMAGE: &str = "public.ecr.aws/d4t4u8d2/sparsity-ai/enclaver-wrapper-base:latest";
```

- The multi-stage Dockerfile `dockerfiles/runtimebase-release.dockerfile` uses the `nitro-cli` image as a build source and copies runtime libraries and `/usr/bin/nitro-cli` from it into the runtime image.

- The dev helper `scripts/build-docker-images.sh` builds local dev images `odyn-dev:latest` and `enclaver-wrapper-base:latest` for local development.

What each image is for (summary)
--------------------------------

1. Nitro CLI image (`nitro-cli`)
   - Purpose: Provides the `nitro-cli` binary and the system libraries required to run it.
   - In the build pipeline the repo runs `nitro-cli build-enclave` inside a container based on this image to convert a Docker image into an EIF.
  - In the runtime Dockerfile (`runtimebase-release.dockerfile`) the image is used as a source stage to extract runtime libraries and the `nitro-cli` executable into the final container image.

2. ODYN image (`odyn`)
   - Purpose: Contains the `odyn` supervisor binary (the supervisor that is inserted into the amended app image and executed inside the enclave).
   - `build::amend_source_image` copies the supervisor binary from this image into the amended app image at `/sbin/odyn`.
   - Dev Dockerfile `odyn-dev.dockerfile` is a minimal image that simply copies a built local `odyn` binary into `/usr/local/bin/odyn` (development flow).

3. Sleeve / wrapper base image (`enclaver-wrapper-base`)
   - Purpose: The release base image which receives the `application.eif` and `enclaver.yaml` files as appended layers. The runtime entrypoint (`enclaver-run`) lives in this image and orchestrates enclave start/stop when the sleeve container runs.
   - The final release image layout is: base sleeve image + layer with `RELEASE_BUNDLE_DIR/enclaver.yaml` + layer with `RELEASE_BUNDLE_DIR/application.eif`.

Notes derived from repository files
----------------------------------
- `runtimebase-release.dockerfile` copies the following from the `nitro-cli` image into the runtime:
  - runtime libraries such as `libssl.so.3`, `libcrypto.so.3`, `libgcc_s.so.1`, `libm.so.6`, `libc.so.6`, `libz.so.1`
  - the `nitro-cli` binary into `/bin/nitro-cli`
  - it also ensures certain paths exist for Nitro Enclaves (`/var/log/nitro_enclaves/`, `/run/nitro_enclaves/`).

- `build.rs` uses the `odyn` image to read a binary (`ODYN_IMAGE_BINARY_PATH = "/usr/local/bin/odyn"`) and copy it into the amended app image.

What the repository does not provide
-----------------------------------
- The repo does not include the full Dockerfiles for the published `public.ecr.aws/...` images themselves. To see the actual full contents (all installed packages, files, and exact entrypoints), you must pull and inspect the images from the registry or examine their published manifests.

Commands to inspect the images locally
-------------------------------------
Use these commands to pull and inspect the published images locally. Replace `<image>` with one of the three image names above.

1) Pull the image

```bash
docker pull public.ecr.aws/s2t1d4c6/enclaver-io/nitro-cli:latest || true
docker pull public.ecr.aws/d4t4u8d2/sparsity-ai/odyn:latest || true
docker pull public.ecr.aws/d4t4u8d2/sparsity-ai/enclaver-wrapper-base:latest || true
```

2) Inspect image metadata and config

```bash
docker image inspect public.ecr.aws/s2t1d4c6/enclaver-io/nitro-cli:latest --format '{{json .}}' | jq .
```

3) View layer history

```bash
docker history public.ecr.aws/s2t1d4c6/enclaver-io/nitro-cli:latest
```

4) Run a short `ls` in the image (non-interactive)

```bash
docker run --rm --entrypoint ls public.ecr.aws/s2t1d4c6/enclaver-io/nitro-cli:latest -la /usr/bin /lib64 || true
```

5) Start an interactive shell (if the image has one) to explore filesystem

```bash
docker run --rm -it --entrypoint /bin/sh public.ecr.aws/s2t1d4c6/enclaver-io/nitro-cli:latest
```

6) Inspect the final sleeve image / release image after you build it locally

```bash
# after running `enclaver build` which tags the release image as e.g. my-release:latest
docker inspect my-release:latest
docker history my-release:latest
docker run --rm --entrypoint ls my-release:latest -la /enclave
```

7) Use `dive` to examine layers interactively (recommended)

```bash
dive public.ecr.aws/d4t4u8d2/sparsity-ai/enclaver-wrapper-base:latest
```

Inspecting the EIF conversion step
---------------------------------
- The repo uses a container (based on the `nitro-cli` image) and runs `nitro-cli build-enclave --docker-uri <tag> --output-file application.eif` inside the container to create the EIF. Because `nitro-cli` insists on pulling by name rather than using a local image id, the build process tags the intermediate amended image with a temporary random tag and calls `nitro-cli` with that tag.

Dev / local images
-------------------
`scripts/build-docker-images.sh` builds local dev images to avoid pulling the remote published images during development. It builds multi-arch crate binaries (via cargo cross-compile target selection) and then builds two dev images:
  - `odyn-dev:latest`
  - `enclaver-wrapper-base:latest` (local sleeve base tag)

Helper: a simple inspection script (optional)
-------------------------------------------
If you want a quick helper, here is a small one-liner you can save as `scripts/inspect-base-images.sh`:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail
images=(
  public.ecr.aws/s2t1d4c6/enclaver-io/nitro-cli:latest
  public.ecr.aws/d4t4u8d2/sparsity-ai/odyn:latest
  public.ecr.aws/d4t4u8d2/sparsity-ai/enclaver-wrapper-base:latest
)

for img in "${images[@]}"; do
  echo "\n=== $img ==="
  docker pull "$img" || true
  docker image inspect "$img" --format 'ID: {{.Id}}\nRepoTags: {{.RepoTags}}\nSize: {{.Size}}' || true
  echo "history:";
  docker history --no-trunc "$img" | sed -n '1,10p'
done
```

Save it and run:

```bash
chmod +x scripts/inspect-base-images.sh
./scripts/inspect-base-images.sh
```

If you want me to add that helper script into the repository, I can create it for you.

Next steps I can take
---------------------
- Add the helper script above into `scripts/` in this repo.
- Pull and inspect the images for you and paste the `docker inspect` and `docker history` summaries here (I will not run Docker commands on your machine; I can provide the exact commands for you to run and parse the output if you prefer).
